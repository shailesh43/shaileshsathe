  about: `
Heyaa, I'm Shailesh — a Design Engineer/Software Developer passionate about creating high-performance, user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs.

With 3+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

One of my key projects, [Astrus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shailesh43.astrus), a minimal and sleek vs code dark mode multivariant theme, surpassing 50+ downloads on [VS code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)'s marketplace.

Let's connect and collaborate!
