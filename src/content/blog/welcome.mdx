This is my **personal space** on the web — a place to share my ideas, projects, and everything that is there.  

This site is built with

- `Next.js` : a React framework for building fast, modern web apps  
- `Tailwind CSS` : utility-first CSS for styling  
- `shadcn/ui` : a beautifully crafted component library  
- `Motion` : animations that bring the UI to life  



I’ve kept the design clean and simple, inspired by the official Tailwind site.  
The focus is on **clarity, readability, and speed**.
