Can't describe how it feels to be followed by someone I truly admire — the creator of something I use and appreciate every day.

Thank you [@shadcn](https://x.com/shadcn) for rethinking how we approach component libraries — your idea of shipping components as code, not packages, has changed the way we build, share, and own our UI. Truly appreciate the clarity and philosophy behind [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
